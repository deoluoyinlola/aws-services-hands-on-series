## Description
The repo contains list of hands-on projects for series of aws services I  have been personally practising over months of learning AWS cloud.

## Pre-requisites
The most basic requirement is having aws account;
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) - cloud platform, offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.

## Demo
I have section each service or project into its .md file. Each file aside README.md and Docs folder in the root of the repo contains the full demo for each project with its appropriate name. While Docs folder contains the image assets and configuration file for each project, you will find every other needed information in each .md

## Resources
The following are some of the basic resources helping me to achieve these hands-on
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) - cloud platform, offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.
- [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)  - a unified tool to manage your AWS services.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.
